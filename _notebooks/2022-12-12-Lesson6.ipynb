    "A library is a collection of precompiled codes that can be used later on in a program for some specific well-defined operations.\n",
    "These precompiled codes can be referred to as modules. Each module contains bundles of code that can be used repeatedly in different programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "A library may also contain documentation, configuration data, message templates, classes, and values, etc.\n",
    "Why are libraries important?\n",
    "Using Libraries makes Python Programming simpler and convenient for the programmer.\n",
    "One example would be through looping and iteration, as we don’t need to write the same code again and again for different programs.\n",
    "Python libraries play a very vital role in fields of Machine Learning, Data Science, Data Visualization, etc.\n",
    "A few libraries that simplify coding processes:\n",
    "\n",
    "Pillow allows you to work with images.\n",
    "Tensor Flow helps with data automation and monitors performance.\n",
    "Matplotlib allows you to make 2D graphs and plots.\n",

    "The AP Exam Refrence Sheet itself is a library!"
