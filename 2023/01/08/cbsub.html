<p>The student reflected on their comparison of their own scoring of a program to the College Board’s AP scoring. They gave the student a 5 out of 6 for the Program Purpose and Function category, while the College Board gave a 4 out of 6. The student realized that they had given the student a point for correctly describing the program purpose, but the student had actually only described the program functionality. The student’s own program will need to include a list to manage complexity in order to avoid missing this point. The student did not get the point in the Program Purpose and Function category because they did not describe the program purpose, and therefore received a 0 out of 1 for this category with no possibility for partial credit.</p>

<p>The student’s grading of the program was consistent with the College Board’s grading. They believe that the program was high quality and met all of the necessary criteria. To ensure success, the student plans to include thorough comments and explanations in their own program and provide multiple examples to demonstrate that they meet the standards set by the College Board. This will ensure that even if one aspect of their program does not meet the criteria, they have other examples that may be accepted.</p>
