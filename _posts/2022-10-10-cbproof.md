### Notes
- A program is developed from an idea and a specific purpose in mind.
- Developers start investigating the problem/purpose and reflect.
- Developers must:
    - determine requirements of program
    - understand the constraints (ex: time)
    - understand user concerns/interests
- Developers investigate using surveys, user testing, interviews, direct observations
- Developers design program by brainstorming, storyboard, plan user experience, layout user interface, organize into modules, develop a testing strategy
- Developers decide on the program requirements that describe how a program should behave, include a liste of user interactions
- Developers create a prototype of program
- Testing, testing, testing!! Very important at micro level and macro level

### Notes 
- Programs are usually developed by teams of people. Individuals work on different functional components. Everyone msut receive credit for what they've done.
- Use comments to give credit. Comments are very useful.
- You can also use code segments written by others, but this needs to be credited.

### Notes
- Program documentation describes the overall program, lists the program specifications, describes functions/procedures/methods
- Documentation happens throughout the development of the program: at the beginning, during, and after
