# Errors 

- errors are a part of coding, they are expected
- Types of Errors:
  - Logic Errors
  - Syntax Errors
  - Run-time Errors
  - Overflow Errors
- Logic Errors - make mistake in algorithm, causing the program to behave differently
- Syntax Errors - making a typo on the code, causing the program to not run (colon/semicolon, parenthesis, braces, indentation, quotes, var def)
- Run-time Errors - works for a bit and then crashes, caused by a certain line of code in the sequence (called a bug)
  - divide by 0
  - improper user input
- Overflow Errors - result in certain values that are too big to show or to calculate


### Notes
- A program is developed from an idea and a specific purpose in mind.
- Developers start investigating the problem/purpose and reflect.
- Developers must:
    - determine requirements of program
    - understand the constraints (ex: time)
    - understand user concerns/interests
- Developers investigate using surveys, user testing, interviews, direct observations
- Developers design program by brainstorming, storyboard, plan user experience, layout user interface, organize into modules, develop a testing strategy
- Developers decide on the program requirements that describe how a program should behave, include a liste of user interactions
- Developers create a prototype of program
- Testing, testing, testing!! Very important at micro level and macro level
