### Notes on 1.2 Daily Video 1
- Categories of Innovations include Applications (games, social media, productivity), Physical Devices (computers, tablets, smart "things"), Systems (E-commerce, email).
- You want to think about some guiding questions when you think about purpose:
    - Why does the computing innovation exist?
    - What problem(s) does the computing innovation solve?
    - What does the computing innovation allow us to do that we could not before?

### Notes on 1.2 Daily Video 2
- Computer programs accept input in a variety of different forms (tacile aka touch, audio, visual, text).
- Programs are mostly event-driven --> events (mouse clicks, screen taps/swipes, physical button clicks, eyboard entries, audio keywords/phrases) are triggered by actions, which sends input to the program
- Input affects output of a program
- Outputs can be visual, audio, tactile (touch/feel like vibrations), text

### Notes on 1.2 Daily Video 3
- A program (aka software) is a collection of statements.
    - A statement is a single command, a group of statements is a code segment
- Describing code segments:
    - Simply state what it does
    - Include what it does/how it does it

### Collegeboard Quiz
I took the Program Function and Purpose Quiz MCQ.

### Hack Questions
My group's final project idea is to create a scheduling/planning website where you can plan out your events and schedule. We also want to add other features like mood tracking! It can be like a well-being app, related to journaling and psychology. It's like related to the Psychology and Good Life video we watched.

It is for an educational purpose because it'll help us develop our coding things. The project is able to be expanded and thus will hold our interest for 8 weeks because we can add additional features such as rating your productivity in the day, rating how happy you were, etc.

This project does have the potential for someone to use it beyond the 8 weeks because planning/scheduling is very important to people's lives.

This project does have potential for the Create Performance Task submission:
1. Program Purpose and Function
- The purpose of the program is to provide a platform in which users can schedule and plan out their day, as well as take into account their mindfulness and mental health.
2. Data Abstraction
- Information such as ratings and scales will be stored in lists, which demonstrates data abstraction.
3. Managing Complexity
- The list will have to contain the items to display.
4. Procedural Abstraction
- The procedures will involve creating events or tasks, or creating journal entries.
5. Algorithm Implementation
- Looping through days and months and years will require algorithm implementation.
6. Testing
- There can be functions such as "overview of your week" that need to call different values from different places.
