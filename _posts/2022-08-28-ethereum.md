## Insights:

Ethereum has recently been dipping a lot, and on September 15th, Ethereum 2 is coming out, which will change Ethereum into a proof of stake system. This is pretty cool and can increase Ethereum's price potentially.

A few reasons why proof of stake for Ethereum is important:

- Faster transactions
- Reduces amount of energy used
- More secure for validators


I am looking forward to the upcoming Ethereum 2 release, lets see what happens to Ethereum's price as well, I will update on this topic soon, see you all soon!
