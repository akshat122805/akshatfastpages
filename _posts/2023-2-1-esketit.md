1. Older people use facebook, 24-35
2. Tiktok has younger people, 10-19

More of a generation gap than purposeful exclusion.


# Why we use female voices
3. As tech futurist and author Bernard Marr tells Cosmopolitan UK, â€œResearch might suggest that humans have a preference for the sound of female voices, and studies have found that female voices tend to articulate vowel sounds more clearly which makes them easier to understand.

> Promotes bias or misconception that all women are assistants 

3. Tiktok influences a ton of people because of its trend. 

In addition we can always add more to it and add more as we go on. We can also add more and more as we go on and add even more. As we progress we can keep continuing to add more and more and more. 

# Pair work (Video on HP computers are racist)
1: Does the owner of the computer think this was intentional?
A1: It's hard to tell, but he seems to be jokingly upset at the computer for not recognizing him for his skin color.

2: How do you think this happened?
A2: I think it was because of the bad lighting in the video. Additionally, the face recognition program may have been trained on people with lighter skin.

3: Is this harmful? Was it intended to be harmful or exclude?
A3: Yes, it is harmful because it excludes a large group of people. I don't think it was intended to be harmful because that would be bad business.

4: Should it be corrected?
A4: Yes.

5: What would you or should you do to produce a better outcome?
A5: Train the facial recognition program with darker skin color.

# 5.3 Summary
What is computing bias?
Computing bias are flaws in a computer algorithm or program where it unjustly favors one input or demographic rather than another. This could be intentional or unintentional. One example of computing bias is HP's facial recognition program, and how it works better with lighter-skinned people. This is most likely a result of the lack of training with people of darker skin tones.

# 5.4 Notes

## Group work ~10 min
List of API's we've used:
- Car API
- Wikipedia API
- Medical symptoms API
- Flashcards API

Biggest discovery in Github would be the github.dev viewer. It lets you view any raw file in github.

The top 10 or 20 datasets on kaggle are pretty random, but relevant to social trends.

## Hacks YESSIR
A good crowdsourcing method for CSP students would most likely take advantage of Slack features, such as the emoji reactions. This can be used to receive feedback from the students that are in the Slack channel.

Del Norte crowdsourcing could be done through instagram polls, since most students have an instagram account and are accessible on that platform. Crowdsourcing would definitely be beneficial for our project because it is all about the user experience, so we could have groups of people test certain features and provide feedback through a poll.

We could collect general ratings from 1-10 of our site at N@MT, which could tell us more about the popularity and execution of our idea.
