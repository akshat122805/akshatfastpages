## Minima to Hacker

- So basically what I did was change the theme of my fastpages from minima to hacker. But this resulted in my HTML crashing and my website completely crashing!!!
- Everything basically became alligned to the left, which shows how much of a component CSS is.
- Dropdown menu is no longer functioning

## Constraints of Changing Theme
 

- After changing the theme to hacker, I noticed that every code that I ran![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/BashInHacker.png "https://github.com/LiavB2/ominicient-lavebear") in "Bash Kernel" just became text (like a markdown).

## Search Feature

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/search.png "https://github.com/LiavB2/ominicient-lavebear")

- Using the search page, you can see the ability to search for any key words that pop up throughout the fastpages website.
- This image displays a search for "Python" and it outputs links to every page/post/markdown/notebook on the website that contains python in it.

## Tagging

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/tags.png "https://github.com/LiavB2/ominicient-lavebear")

- As you can see, the fastpages website has tags for any markdown post or Jupyter notebook, and any post that contains code blocks with Bash or Python Kernel.
- Under the 4 tags that are present you can see every post/markdown in the website that contains each of the tags (categories).
