## Minima to Hacker

- So basically what I did was change the theme of my fastpages from minima to hacker. But this resulted in my HTML crashing and my website completely crashing!!!
- Everything basically became alligned to the left, which shows how much of a component CSS is.
- Dropdown menu is no longer functioning

## Search Feature

- Using the search function, I can find all my notes for CSP and any other class as well.


## Tagging

- As you can see, there are assorted tags for each category for my fastpages.
