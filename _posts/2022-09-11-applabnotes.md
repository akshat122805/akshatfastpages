Program Purpose: The purpose of the quiz game is to learn more about sports. There are five questions and then there is a survey at the end. The best thing to do is have fun and take the best guess to do best. 

Functionality: The quiz is built around three simple MC questions that have an input and output, if you get it right, you have a correct screen as an output, if you get it wrong, you have an incorrect screen as an output. The FRQ is also like that, and has one or two responses as correct answers which leads to two different outputs.
