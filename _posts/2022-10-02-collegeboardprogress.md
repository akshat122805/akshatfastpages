# Project Purpose & Objectives

- Through this project, we would like to use student inputted data to calculate their chances of getting into every Ivy league college.

# What is the inputted data?

- The program's input will be the different factors that change a student's chance of getting into an Ivy league. We will be focusing on the following factors: 

- Intended major
- GPA
- SAT/ACT scores
- Gender
- Ethnicity
- Extra Cirriculars
- Clubs
- Essay
- Leadership

# How are we going to do this

The output of the program will be in the format of a percentage chance of getting accepted into each ivy league college. 

- Brown University
- Columbia University
- Cornell University
- Dartmouth University
- Harvard University
- Princeton University
- University of Pennsylvania
- Yale University

# Project Concept (continued):

Furthermore, to get an accurate output, data from multiple sources will be used for each college, primarily acceptance rate data over the past 5 years for each college, based on the student data mentioned previously. 

# Frontend: Design Methodology

We need to make a aesthetic design, we are going to use bootstrap in synthesis with the normal HTML and CSS.
