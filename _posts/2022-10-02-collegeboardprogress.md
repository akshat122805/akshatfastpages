# Project Purpose & Objectives

- Through this project, we would like to use student inputted data to calculate their chances of getting into every Ivy league college.

# What is the inputted data?

- The program's input will be the different factors that change a student's chance of getting into an Ivy league. We will be focusing on the following factors: 

- Intended major
- GPA
- SAT/ACT scores
- Gender
- Ethnicity
- Extra Cirriculars
- Clubs
- Essay
- Leadership

# How are we going to do this

The output of the program will be in the format of a percentage chance of getting accepted into each ivy league college. 

- Brown University
- Columbia University
- Cornell University
- Dartmouth University
- Harvard University
- Princeton University
- University of Pennsylvania
- Yale University

# Project Concept (continued):

Furthermore, to get an accurate output, data from multiple sources will be used for each college, primarily acceptance rate data over the past 5 years for each college, based on the student data mentioned previously. 

# Frontend: Design Methodology

We need to make a aesthetic design, we are going to use bootstrap in synthesis with the normal HTML and CSS.

- Program Purpose: To assign the right college for each person and determine if they can get into an ivy league.
- Data Abstraction: Task the right variables, organize colleges coherently.
- Managing Complexity: Since we plan on using an API in our project, this means that we will be handling a lot of data, hence organization is required. We plan on doing this with lists and dictionaries to create and format our API in key-value pairs. This will be crucial to the function, organization, and efficiency of our project. 
- Procedural Abstraction: The search engine will be able to narrow down the results of the different colleges the user may get into. 
- Algorithm: We are going to create a function that takes user inputs and compares them to a list of data that we have from the API.
- Testing: Single tests that we can perform on our project can include individually testing each function. That way we don't code everything, mess up and struggle to find the error later.



# Backend Program 

We are going to use Jupyter notebooks

We will use JS and Python.

That's it for now, thanks!
