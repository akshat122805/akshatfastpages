# AppLab Ideas 

## Planning:  Design 

For this task, we had to create a quiz of our interest, we had to choose how many questions as well. I decided to plan my quiz as a sports quiz, in which each question would specifically ask about an individual sport and a prominent player/team for the sport. My other team members also decided to make a quiz for the sport they play. A vital step to creating this quiz was to utilize the "onDemand" code, along with, "setscreen", these commands were important for switching screens for every button that is clicked. 

For my quiz specifically, I decided to include multiple choice questions as well as one free response question and a choice question which consists of a dropdown menu. After that, I started off with an NFL question, an NBA question, a NHL question, as well as questions about Cricket and Tennis. 

I had a fun time thinking about how I was going to design my quiz, and eventually after I decided what to do, I got to coding and tried to add unique elements to my quiz that would make it way more different.

## Daily Group Plans

For daily plans, we decided to create a group chat and message each other of what we were planning to add to our quiz.

By doing this, we also got ideas on how to visually make our quiz look better as well as what else I could possibly add to my quiz. 

## Planning Steps

Steps before coding:

- Deciding what the quiz should be about
- How the quiz will work
- How the quiz will start/end
- How the quiz will look
