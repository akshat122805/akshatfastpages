# Overall

Overall I scored 45/50, I was aiming for this score because it satisfied a 5 on the AP scale. Moreover, Mr. Mortensen said how the students who did best and reflected on their work all got very nice internships, something that I am aiming for. 

# Test Corrections
- Question 15
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/question15.png">

I chose C, because I thought users would provide documentation for program code. This is wrong however, because users are unlikely to have the expertise needed to understand and provide documentation for program code. 

D is the correct answer, because users ca help for design and development.

- Question 34
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/question34.png">

I chose D because I thought combining all three lists would make sense. This is incorrect.

B is the correct answer because the code segment intializes firstList to contain the first three, so the code segment then swaps the contents of firstList and secondList by assigning firstList to thirdList, and so on, and so on, like third to second. 

- Question 36
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/question36.png">

I chose B because I thought it was initialized to 0 instead of 1. The correct answer is C because it is initialized to 1m so it would be 13,15,17,19,21

- Question 44
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/question44.png">

I guessed on this and chose B, this is incorrect because for any integer, the value of MOD 2 is either 0 or 1.

The correct answer is C because 23/3 has a remainder of two, so 3 is the correct option.

- Question 46
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/question46.png">

I chose D because I thought that when the third statements assigns the value of first, the fourth would assign the second making it also false. 

This is incorrect , I simply chose false instead of true but the graphic show that is asks for the true variable and Option A is correct because it specifies the true variable for both first and second value. 


# Test Explanations, why I chose what I chose
- For Question 1, I chose D because the loop is repeating 3 times which makes sense for the code segment to be multiplied by three or cubed. 
- For Question 2, it was just an observational question, when x is negative, y is assigned the value true and value of y is displayed. 
- For Question 3, I figured software testing is always going to be needed even if there is good communication. 
- For Question 4, observing member list for food allergies and dietary restrictions. 
- For Question 5, Brandon's list is not needed.
- For Question 6, the value of count is displayed in the loop which is then split into 1s, so all odd integers are printed.
- For Question 7, the code segment adds x and y and then divides x.
- For Question 8, the difference between numList and newList is that the elements j and k are interchanged. 
- For Question 9, 3-7 reduces the score if it is not set to 0.
- For Question 10, having no communication would probably screw up the entire project. 
- For Question 11, the algorithm uses myList for 2 loops, the outerloops uses the first element in the list which corresponds to the second to last question.
- For Question 12, the information is provided by the restaurant, not the customer. 
- For Question 13, the list does not only have positive values, the loop returns when it hits a positive value and returns when it hits a negative value. 
- For Question 14, check minus is displayed for 8 and 6, both in between 7 at the top.
- For Question 16, each packet contains data to be transmitted, so I figured that each packet would be reassembled by the recipients device itself. 
- Question 17, protocols follow a set of rules, D makes the most sense,
- Question 18, C made the most sense to me, because it said the word network.
- Question 19, 1111 is the max for four bits, which is equal to 15. 15+14=29, so its an overflow I guess.
- Question 20, I figured four bits would be 2 to the 4th power, which is 16. 
- Question 21, 1 2 and 3 make all sense, binary is everything in Computer Science :)
- Question 22, I figured this is binary mathematics, I'm going to be honest, I guessed on this one,
- Question 23, analog data has values that change a lot. So the samples are represented digitally, so I chose D because it talks about sequence of bits. 
- Question 24, binary mathematics again
- Question 25, age is a number, number makes sense.
- Question 26, true or false option, boolean?
- Question 27, string makes the best sense for a student name.
- Question 28, units used is about 25 or less, the cost is times the number of units. I just used math for this. 
Question 29, lists are data, so list makes allowing to insert data. 
- Question 30, numeric data is also good for lists.
- Question 31, I guessed h, but it make sense because index 3 has ghi, and the second letter of ghi is h. 
- Question 32, it says yourlist equals mylist, so 10,30,50,70 equals 10,30,50,70. 
- Question 33, it says greater than or equal to 90, and left to right. 
- Question 35, maxPS to 50 by default, if statements were confusing tho but I just chose A and D. 
- Question 37, the values keep interchanging, and num1 has to equal num2 and temp has to equal both. But it would make sense for the second statement to be in the middle.
- Question 38, same reasoning as last question.
- Question 39, hello would not make sense, also negative numbers would not make any sense for lists, it was between 2.5 or 4, but 2.5 had a decimal, so I chose 4.
- Question 40, 3-5=-2
- Question 41, q is 20, p is q so p is 20, r is q so r is 20, r is p so r is once again 20. 
- Question 42, IF blocks make up 8+4+4=16
- Question 43,  integer is based at 0 and exceeds 5 when the loop is eliminated, so 10 or 15 makes sense, I guessed 15,
- Question 45, match the lists, the list contains 2 positive values, so count1 is count2 and count2 is 3. 
- Question 47, I did the math for each and then put them in order.
- Question 48, both x and z have the value of 50 so I chose C.
- Question 49, well on backwards is no so no+on = noon. 
- Question 50, first name goes first so I chose A, and last names goes second, which is why I chose A.
