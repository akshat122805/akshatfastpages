## Goals for CSP This Year:

Hi! My name is Akshat, I have several goals for CSP this year! 

- I want to learn python and understand the fundamentals of it
- I want to understand how python is used and why it is so vital in the computing world
- I also want to understand the projects I will be doing, and having fun at the same time!

I am very excited for this class, and I look forward to working on it!
