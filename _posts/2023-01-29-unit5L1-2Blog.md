# 5.1 Reflection

Pros and cons of Computer Science

The advancement of computer technology has enabled us to achieve greater productivity, efficiency, and access to educational resources. On one hand, this has revolutionized the way we live and work, with faster communication, data processing, and problem-solving capabilities. However, it has also led to job automation and a decrease in employment opportunities. Furthermore, the internet and computer technology have provided a greater level of connectivity and globalization, bridging geographical and cultural divides. This has enabled collaboration and understanding between people from different backgrounds, but has also contributed to the spread of hate speech, cyber-bullying, and a decrease in face-to-face interactions. Taken together, computer technology has had both beneficial and detrimental effects on our lives.

Benefits of our project:
- Entertaining for the user if they are bored
- It's a good way to spend time with friends or family and have fun together
- It's a learning experience for everyone involved

Potential con of our project:
- It may be slightly buggy (it was developed by high schoolers)

Dopamine issues:

Modern technology has led to a lot more issues of people, especially teens, being desensitized to dopamine. This is why dopamine detox lifestyles are common in people who want to better themselves. Nowadays things like social media provide people with dopamine with the simple action of a scroll from one 15 second video to another. This is also one reason why the attention span of people has decreased to under 10 seconds. 

To combat this, content creators have adapted their products to amuse the viewer within those 10 seconds, giving the viewer a boost of dopamine that otherwise would not have happened. These continuous boosts of dopamine pose a problem with the desensitization of dopamine among teens and may explain the increased rates of depression and anxiety in Gen Z kids. I personally would say that I spend an extended amount of time on social media.

Steps to digital empowerment:

Develop digital literacy skills: Learn how to use technology effectively and safely, including online privacy and security.

Build a strong online presence: Develop a personal brand and create a professional profile on social media platforms.

Protect personal data: Secure passwords, limit personal information shared online, and be aware of potential scams.

Stay informed: Stay updated with the latest technology trends and advancements to be able to make informed decisions.

Network and collaborate: Connect with like-minded people and build a professional network.

Continuously learn and adapt: Stay curious and open to learning new skills and technologies to stay ahead in a constantly evolving digital world.

As I would consider myself relatively digitally empowered, some ways I can help someone who is not empowered include:

Showing them how to do something they need to do (step by step)

Giving rules of thumb here and there

Helping them set up their technology and tools for how they will use them.

Paper and red tape can act as barriers to digital empowerment, as they can slow down processes and limit access to information. These traditional systems can be time-consuming and bureaucratic, making it difficult for individuals to access resources or services.
