I remember making a donut in 3D animation 1, good times, I think Blender is very useful for many applications, this was really cool, great job. 

# Summary 
Great work happening here, I loved the projects and I got to see a lot of cool hardworking people be passionate for their project. I visited many different applications and website which had different functions entirely. I went to other classes as well like Ceramics and 3D Animation and I enjoyed their projects and presentation as well. I think our project, TripleAJ Arcade, got a lot of people interested too and many people had a blast playing our games. Overall this Night @ The Museum is a 10/10 experience for me!!
