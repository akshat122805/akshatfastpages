<p>For this task, we had to create a quiz of our interest, we had to choose how many questions as well. I decided to plan my quiz as a sports quiz, in which each question would specifically ask about an individual sport and a prominent player/team for the sport. My other team members also decided to make a quiz for the sport they play. A vital step to creating this quiz was to utilize the “onDemand” code, along with, “setscreen”, these commands were important for switching screens for every button that is clicked.</p>

<p>For my quiz specifically, I decided to include multiple choice questions as well as one free response question and a choice question which consists of a dropdown menu. After that, I started off with an NFL question, an NBA question, a NHL question, as well as questions about Cricket and Tennis.</p>

<p>I had a fun time thinking about how I was going to design my quiz, and eventually after I decided what to do, I got to coding and tried to add unique elements to my quiz that would make it way more different.</p>

<p>For daily plans, we decided to create a group chat and message each other of what we were planning to add to our quiz.</p>

<p>By doing this, we also got ideas on how to visually make our quiz look better as well as what else I could possibly add to my quiz.</p>

<p>Steps before coding:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Deciding what the quiz should be about</li>
  <li>How the quiz will work</li>
  <li>How the quiz will start/end</li>
  <li>How the quiz will look</li>
</ul>
