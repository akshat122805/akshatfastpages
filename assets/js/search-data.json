            "content": "Calling Procedures . Slide 1: . A ___ is a named group of programming instructions that may have parameters and return values. | Procedures are referred to by different names, such as ___ or ___, depending on the programing language. | Parameters are input values of a procedure. ___ specify the values of the parameters when procedure is called. | A procedure call interrupts the ___ execution of statements causing the program to execute the statements within the procedure before continuing. One the last statement in the procedure (or a return statement) has executed, flow or control is returned to the point immediately following where the procedure was ___. | . Slide 2: . When calling procedures, it&#39;s important to take notice to whether it returns data, or a block of ___. | If the procedure just returns a block of statements, you call the procedure by referring to the procedure name, and ___ the arguments. | If the procedure returns some sort of data like a __ or ___, then you will assign that value to a variable | . Slide 3: . Assume the Temperature outside is Fahrenheit. | The procedure convertFahrenheit is intended to convert from Fahrenheit to Celsius. | Convert the following psuedocode to python | . def convertFahrenheit(): # code goes here return celsius convertFahrenheit(outsideTemp) . Developing Procedures . Slide 8: . Picking a ___ name is important in case you revisit the code later on (separate words with capitals) There are 2 different types of procedures- ones that return a value and those that simply execute a block of statements Steps of developing procedure: picking a useful name, thinking of parameters (what data does the procedure need to know), making a flowchart or writing procedure in pseudocode, and actually developing the procedure. . Slide 9: . In this example, a teacher is writing a program that will replace the grade on a previous quiz if the new grade is better than the previous. . What would be a good name for this procedure? | What parameters do we need for this procedure? | Try writing this procedure out in python based on the given pseudocode | . currentGrade &lt;- currentPoints / 40 currentGrade &lt;- current Grade * 100 if currentGrade &gt; quizGrade quizGrade &lt;- currentGrade . Procedural Abstraction . One type of abstraction is __ abstraction which provides a name for a process and allows a procedure to be used only knowing what it does and not how it does it | This is very helpful in managing __ in a program | Subdivision of a program into separate subprograms is called __ | A procedural abstraction may __ shared features to generalize functionality instead of duplicating code. This allows for program reuse, which helps manage complexity | When a pre-written procedure is called, you don’t necessarily need to know the details of this, just what it does and how to call it | Simply, procedural abstraction is naming and calling a __ procedure | Making sure to include the right arguments so the __ can do what its supposed to do is crucial | . Complexity Example . One of the biggest advantages of procedural abstraction is managing complexity. . Think about the process of simplifying the code? What do you think the advantage of the code segment on the left is? . Code Segment 1 Code Segment 2 . ROTATE_LEFT() | detourLeft() | . MOVE_FORWARD()|turnCorner()| ROTATE_RIGHT |MOVE_FORWARD()| MOVE_FORWARD()|MOVE_FORWARD()| MOVE_FORWARD() ROTATE_RIGHT() MOVE_FORWARD() ROTATE_LEFT() MOVE_FORWARD() ROTATE_LEFT() MOVE_FORWARD() MOVE_FORWARD MOVE_FORWARD() . Hacks . Write a python procedure about something which can help you in school, for example the teacher’s function we spoke about earlier. | Points will be awarded based on creativity and functionality | 0.1 points will be deducted for late submissions | Submit the notes with all blanks filled in (scored out of 0.5 points) and the python procedure (scored out of 0.5 points) by Monday 12/12 at 11:59 PM. | . def procedure() # code goes here return # code goes here .",

Sequence of variables | used rto store multiple items in a variable | Ordered and flexible | . sports = [&quot;football&quot;, &quot;hockey&quot;, &quot;baseball&quot;, &quot;basketball&quot;] # change the value &quot;soccer&quot; to &quot;hockey&quot; print (sports) .

[&#39;football&#39;, &#39;soccer&#39;, &#39;golf&#39;, &#39;basketball&#39;] . Iterations . Iteration is the repetition of a process or utterance applied to the result or taken from a previous statement. There&#39;s a lot of types of iteration though, what to use? How do we apply iteration to lists? . Some methods include using a &quot;for loop&quot;, using a &quot;for loop and range()&quot;, using a &quot;while loop&quot;, and using comprehension . Lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets are iterable objects. They are the &#39;containers&#39; that store the data to iterate. . Each of these containers are able to iterate with the iter() command. . There are 2 types of iteration:definite and indefinite. Definite iteration clarifies how many times the loop is going to run, while indefinite specifies a condition that must be met. . When an object is iterable it can be used in an iteration. . When passed through the function iter() it returns an iterator. . Strings, lists, dictionaries, sets and tuples are all examples of iterable objects. . a = [&#39;alpha&#39;, &#39;bravo&#39;, &#39;charlie&#39;] itr = iter(a) print(next(itr)) print(next(itr)) print(next(itr)) . alpha bravo charlie . Loops . Well, above is basically just printing them again, so how do we takes these iterators into something we can make use for? Loops take essentially what we did above and automates it, here are some examples. . list = [&quot;Alpha&quot;, &quot;Bravo&quot;, &quot;Charlie&quot;, &quot;Delta&quot;, &quot;Echo&quot;, &quot;Foxtrot&quot;, &quot;Golf&quot;, &quot;Hotel&quot;, &quot;India&quot;, &quot;Juliett&quot;, &quot;Kilo&quot;, &quot;Lima&quot;, &quot;Mike&quot;, &quot;November&quot;, &quot;Oscar&quot;, &quot;Papa&quot;, &quot;Quebec&quot;, &quot;Romeo&quot;, &quot;Sierra&quot;, &quot;Tango&quot;, &quot;Uniform&quot;, &quot;Victor&quot;, &quot;Whiskey&quot;, &quot;X-ray&quot;, &quot;Yankee&quot;, &quot;Zulu&quot;] # using a for loop for i in list: #for item in the list, print the item print(i) .

SAVES MORE TIME! . x = range(5) for n in x: print(n) . 0 1 2 3 4 . 2D Iterations . A 2D array is simply just a list of lists. The example below is technically correct but conventially 2D arrays are written like below. This is because 2D arrays are meant to be read in 2 dimensions (hence the name). Writing them like below makes them easier to visualize and understand. . keypad = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [&quot; &quot;, 0, &quot; &quot;]] . Conventially 2D arrays are written like below.

            "content": "Variables, Assignments, Data Abstraction . Notes . A variable is an abstraction that can hold inside a program and hold the value. . Contains three parts: . Name | Value | Type | . Name variables are short and not as specific. Do not make your code for variables too complicated because it can become messy. However, do not make your variables too vague. . Types of data: . Integer | Text/string | Boolean | . Strings consist of a key word, the second variables would be considered as integers as it would display a number. The third variable would be a boolean because it shows if anything is true or false. . A list of data can also be stored in variables. This is useful as it can print/retrieve specific values n the list without creating lots of variables. . Assignments . Operators that allow the program to change the value represented by a variable. . Some operators: . = (assigns both right and left) (a=b) | += (a+b=ab) | -= (a-b=a-b) | and so on | . The value stored in a variable will be the most recent value assigned. . Changing Values: Change any value, but the most recent value will be the output. . Data Abstraction . Data abstraction is a method used in coding to represent data in useful forms in applicable scenarios. . Data abstraction has tools likes variables and lists which are very important. . Lists and Strings . A list is an ordered sequence of elements, an element is a specific value in that list to a unique index. An index is a reference to the elements in the string. . A string is a ordered sequence of characters. . Example of a list: EXAMPLE - WE USE COLORS: . colorsList=[&quot;pink&quot;, &quot;yellow&quot;, &quot;green&quot;, &quot;blue, &quot;orange&quot;, &quot;purple&quot;] . print(colorsList) . ^ Now it will print the colors and the list you defined along with the specific colors, which are the elements. .

            "content": "Final Score: Took about an hour to 1 hour 15 mins. . Overall . Overall I scored 45/50, I was aiming for this score because it satisfied a 5 on the AP scale. Moreover, Mr. Mortensen said how the students who did best and reflected on their work all got very nice internships, something that I am aiming for. . Test Corrections . Question 15 | . I chose C, because I thought users would provide documentation for program code. This is wrong however, because users are unlikely to have the expertise needed to understand and provide documentation for program code. . D is the correct answer, because users ca help for design and development. . Question 34 | . I chose D because I thought combining all three lists would make sense. This is incorrect. . B is the correct answer because the code segment intializes firstList to contain the first three, so the code segment then swaps the contents of firstList and secondList by assigning firstList to thirdList, and so on, and so on, like third to second. . Question 36 | . I chose B because I thought it was initialized to 0 instead of 1. The correct answer is C because it is initialized to 1m so it would be 13,15,17,19,21 . Question 44 | . I guessed on this and chose B, this is incorrect because for any integer, the value of MOD 2 is either 0 or 1. . The correct answer is C because 23/3 has a remainder of two, so 3 is the correct option. . Question 46 | . I chose D because I thought that when the third statements assigns the value of first, the fourth would assign the second making it also false. . This is incorrect , I simply chose false instead of true but the graphic show that is asks for the true variable and Option A is correct because it specifies the true variable for both first and second value. . Strengths and Weakness . I had a tough time with observational questions which were questions that involved loops and arrays and much more. Also some binary question were hard. . | I had a good time guessing and doing good on binary questions. I also understood and answered user interface questions correctly and communications affecting a project questions. . | . Test Explanations, why I chose what I chose . For Question 1, I chose D because the loop is repeating 3 times which makes sense for the code segment to be multiplied by three or cubed. | For Question 2, it was just an observational question, when x is negative, y is assigned the value true and value of y is displayed. | For Question 3, I figured software testing is always going to be needed even if there is good communication. | For Question 4, observing member list for food allergies and dietary restrictions. | For Question 5, Brandon’s list is not needed. | For Question 6, the value of count is displayed in the loop which is then split into 1s, so all odd integers are printed. | For Question 7, the code segment adds x and y and then divides x. | For Question 8, the difference between numList and newList is that the elements j and k are interchanged. | For Question 9, 3-7 reduces the score if it is not set to 0. | For Question 10, having no communication would probably screw up the entire project. | For Question 11, the algorithm uses myList for 2 loops, the outerloops uses the first element in the list which corresponds to the second to last question. | For Question 12, the information is provided by the restaurant, not the customer. | For Question 13, the list does not only have positive values, the loop returns when it hits a positive value and returns when it hits a negative value. | For Question 14, check minus is displayed for 8 and 6, both in between 7 at the top. | For Question 16, each packet contains data to be transmitted, so I figured that each packet would be reassembled by the recipients device itself. | Question 17, protocols follow a set of rules, D makes the most sense, | Question 18, C made the most sense to me, because it said the word network. | Question 19, 1111 is the max for four bits, which is equal to 15. 15+14=29, so its an overflow I guess. | Question 20, I figured four bits would be 2 to the 4th power, which is 16. | Question 21, 1 2 and 3 make all sense, binary is everything in Computer Science :) | Question 22, I figured this is binary mathematics, I’m going to be honest, I guessed on this one, | Question 23, analog data has values that change a lot. So the samples are represented digitally, so I chose D because it talks about sequence of bits. | Question 24, binary mathematics again | Question 25, age is a number, number makes sense. | Question 26, true or false option, boolean? | Question 27, string makes the best sense for a student name. | Question 28, units used is about 25 or less, the cost is times the number of units. I just used math for this. Question 29, lists are data, so list makes allowing to insert data. | Question 30, numeric data is also good for lists. | Question 31, I guessed h, but it make sense because index 3 has ghi, and the second letter of ghi is h. | Question 32, it says yourlist equals mylist, so 10,30,50,70 equals 10,30,50,70. | Question 33, it says greater than or equal to 90, and left to right. | Question 35, maxPS to 50 by default, if statements were confusing tho but I just chose A and D. | Question 37, the values keep interchanging, and num1 has to equal num2 and temp has to equal both. But it would make sense for the second statement to be in the middle. | Question 38, same reasoning as last question. | Question 39, hello would not make sense, also negative numbers would not make any sense for lists, it was between 2.5 or 4, but 2.5 had a decimal, so I chose 4. | Question 40, 3-5=-2 | Question 41, q is 20, p is q so p is 20, r is q so r is 20, r is p so r is once again 20. | Question 42, IF blocks make up 8+4+4=16 | Question 43, integer is based at 0 and exceeds 5 when the loop is eliminated, so 10 or 15 makes sense, I guessed 15, | Question 45, match the lists, the list contains 2 positive values, so count1 is count2 and count2 is 3. | Question 47, I did the math for each and then put them in order. | Question 48, both x and z have the value of 50 so I chose C. | Question 49, well on backwards is no so no+on = noon. | Question 50, first name goes first so I chose A, and last names goes second, which is why I chose A. | .",

We will be focusing on the following factors: . | Intended major | GPA | SAT/ACT scores | Gender | Ethnicity | Extra Cirriculars | Clubs | Essay | Leadership | . How are we going to do this . The output of the program will be in the format of a percentage chance of getting accepted into each ivy league college. . Brown University | Columbia University | Cornell University | Dartmouth University | Harvard University | Princeton University | University of Pennsylvania | Yale University | . Project Concept (continued): . Furthermore, to get an accurate output, data from multiple sources will be used for each college, primarily acceptance rate data over the past 5 years for each college, based on the student data mentioned previously. . Frontend: Design Methodology . We need to make a aesthetic design, we are going to use bootstrap in synthesis with the normal HTML and CSS. . . Program Purpose: To assign the right college for each person and determine if they can get into an ivy league. | Data Abstraction: Task the right variables, organize colleges coherently. | Managing Complexity: Since we plan on using an API in our project, this means that we will be handling a lot of data, hence organization is required. We plan on doing this with lists and dictionaries to create and format our API in key-value pairs. This will be crucial to the function, organization, and efficiency of our project. | Procedural Abstraction: The search engine will be able to narrow down the results of the different colleges the user may get into. | Algorithm: We are going to create a function that takes user inputs and compares them to a list of data that we have from the API. | Testing: Single tests that we can perform on our project can include individually testing each function. That way we don’t code everything, mess up and struggle to find the error later. | . Backend Program . We are going to use Jupyter notebooks . We will use JS and Python. .

Functionality: The quiz is built around three simple MC questions that have an input and output, if you get it right, you have a correct screen as an output, if you get it wrong, you have an incorrect screen as an output. The FRQ is also like that, and has one or two responses as correct answers which leads to two different outputs. . FRQ Design . . Successes .

I decided to plan my quiz as a sports quiz, in which each question would specifically ask about an individual sport and a prominent player/team for the sport. My other team members also decided to make a quiz for the sport they play. A vital step to creating this quiz was to utilize the “onDemand” code, along with, “setscreen”, these commands were important for switching screens for every button that is clicked. . For my quiz specifically, I decided to include multiple choice questions as well as one free response question and a choice question which consists of a dropdown menu. After that, I started off with an NFL question, an NBA question, a NHL question, as well as questions about Cricket and Tennis. . I had a fun time thinking about how I was going to design my quiz, and eventually after I decided what to do, I got to coding and tried to add unique elements to my quiz that would make it way more different. . . Daily Group Plans . For daily plans, we decided to create a group chat and message each other of what we were planning to add to our quiz. . By doing this, we also got ideas on how to visually make our quiz look better as well as what else I could possibly add to my quiz. . Planning Steps . Steps before coding: .

            "content": "STUDY THIS: . https://quizlet.com/535655479/biogeochemical-cycles-flash-cards/ . 1.4 Carbon Cycles Part 1: . Ecosystems are result of biotic and abiotic interactions . The carbon cycle is the movement of atoms and molecules containing the element carbon between sources and sinks . Some cycles barely take any time, others take millions! . It is one of the biogeochemical cycle, that means it is self-regulating and naturally occurring movement of chemical molecules through various sources and sinks (reservoirs) . Biogeochemical cycles stabilize and regulate the flow of matter through ecosystems . Biogeochemical cycles can be disrupted by human activity . Carbon Cycle: . In the atmosphere, carbon is found as CO2, we need to move it in the ecosystem, so we use photosynthesis. Photosynthesis transformed the CO2 into glucose, the opposite of photosynthesis is cellular respiration. . The process of decomposition can return CO2 to the atmosphere. Plants, organisms, etc die. During decomposition, CO2 can go down into the soil or deeper into the ocean. . Limestone is the bedrock for many terrestrial ecosystems. . Carbon that gets stored. Gets stored into producers and consumers. . Fossil carbons, fossilized remains of plants and animals, can be in terrestrial aquatic environments. It is a geologic long term deposit of carbon. The process of extraction and combustion results in CO2 being added into the atmosphere, which would disrupt the carbon cycle. . Reservoir Interactions: . Fast carbon cycling: . Fast carbon cycling is largely the movement of carbon compounds through the biosphere (the living organisms on Earth) . | This type of cycling is driven by the cellular metabolism of producers in ecosystems . | . The main biological processes involved in fast carbon cycling are photosynthesis and cellular respiration . | . For fast carbon cycling, the primary carbon reservoir is the atmosphere . | . The length of time a carbon compound spends in the atmosphere is relatively brief . | . Decomposition into more detail: . Return CO2 to the atmosphere through cellular respiration . | Return carbon to the soil or water through breakdown of sugars in the bodies they are decomposing . | . Sedimentation and burial: Organic material can result in a much longer sequestration of carbon compounds. Once the carbon is buried, it is essentially removed from the fast carbon cycle. . Deep ocean sediments and fossil carbon (coal, oil, natural gas) are the largest reservoirs of carbon…and these are the result of sedimentation and burial. . Long term carbon reservoirs can return to cycling via fossil fuel extraction and combustion . And uplift and weathering of limestone. . Carbon is released to the atmosphere when fossil fuels are burned (combustion). Carbon is released into the atmosphere during respiration. . . Photosynthesis removes carbon from the atmosphere . | Sedimentation and burial . | The process of burning combustion results in carbon being released into the atmosphere . | Decomposition returns CO2 back to the atmosphere in the carbon cycle . | . The Nitrogen Cycle: . . Nitrogen Fixation - through the process of lightning or bacteria since N2 cannot be used by several organisms. So N2 is converted into another type of Nitrogen. . Nitrification - Nitrification is a process that converts ammonia and similar nitrogen compounds into nitrite (NO2–) and then nitrate (NO3–). Nitrification can occur in water systems that contain chloramines. The problem is greatest when temperatures are warm and water usage is low. . Source: NH3 . Sink: NO2/NO3 . Ammonification - Ammonification. When an organism excretes waste or dies, the nitrogen in its tissues is in the form of organic nitrogen (e.g. amino acids, DNA). Various fungi and prokaryotes then decompose the tissue and release inorganic nitrogen back into the ecosystem as ammonia in the process known as ammonification. . Assimilation - Assimilation. Assimilation is the process by which plants and animals incorporate the NO3- and ammonia formed through nitrogen fixation and nitrification. Plants take up these forms of nitrogen through their roots, and incorporate them into plant proteins and nucleic acids. . Denitrification - Denitrification. Denitrification is the process that converts nitrate to nitrogen gas, thus removing bioavailable nitrogen and returning it to the atmosphere. Dinitrogen gas (N2) is the ultimate end product of denitrification, but other intermediate gaseous forms of nitrogen exist . The Phosphorus Cycle: . The phosphorus cycle is the movement of atoms and molecules containing the element phosphorus between sources and sinks . The phosphorus cycle can be disrupted by human activity . ______ . It is a SLOW cycle, driven mainly by geologic processes. . Phosphorus has NO atmospheric and gas stage . Phosphorus is considered a LIMITING factor in ecosystems (nitrogen is also a limiting factor) . Producers need phosphorus to grow making them vitally important in ecosystems . | Fertilizer contains phosphorus . | . . STEPS: . Start from rocks | Sediments and rocks are a major reservoir for phosphorus | . Uplift and weathering leads to phosphorus dissolving in soil . That soil phosphorus can be dissolved into lakes or streams, OR terrestrial food webs . The runoff will take the soil phosphorus that went into terrestrial food webs, from terrestrial food webs to marine food webs. . If it is runoff into the ocean, it eventually becomes sedimented in the bottom of the ocean through Lithification. . Assimilation is the process from terrestrial food webs to take up phosphorus . What is the process that movies phosphorus from rocks into soil? Uplifting and Weathering . What is the process that movies phosphorus from soil into plants? Uplifting and Weathering . . Sediments . | Uplifting and sedimentary . | The dissolved phosphorus would make its way into the marine food webs through runoff. The phosphorus would also go through sedimentation in the ocean. . | The Hydrologic Cycle . Movement of water, one of four cycles, can be disrupted. . Hydrologic cycle is driven by the SUN . Oceans are the primary reservoir for water . Ice caps and ground water reserved are smaller reservoirs (fresh water) . . STEPS: . Begins with sun, driver of the entire cycle. Why? Because it drives evaporation, it drives water up into the atmosphere. . Sublimation (Solid to gaseous without passing through liquid state) . Once the water is in the atmosphere (a reservoir), it has to come down again, so the next step is precipitation (rain, fog, drip, dew, etc.) . Once its back into terrestrial ecosystems, it collects through ice, snow, and glaciers. It also connects to lakes, wetlands, etc. . Surface runoff and snowmelt runoff help retrieve water into rivers and freshwater lakes. . Anytime precipitation falls in an area that cannot absorb it, this causes a runoff, which leads to the water into another body of water. . The water that is able to penetrate into terrestrial ecosystems enters back through infiltration and seepage. . Once it infiltrates, it can go to several locations like groundwater storage. . Eventually the groundwater ends up back in the oceans, and evaporation is repeated again thus continuing the cycle. . . Precipitation . | A higher temperature would result in more evaporation of the Earth’s water. This would also result in a larger amount of precipitation. Under certain circumstances this could also produce more severe weather events such as storms, and hurricanes. . | Runoff is more likely to increase since the precipitation is more likely to land on buildings with impervious surfaces instead of grounds that could absorb water. This can reduce groundwater recharge and cause droughts to become more severe. (Interesting) . | Ecosystem Mr. Hendricks Notes: .",
