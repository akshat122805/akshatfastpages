            "content": "Class and Object Terms . The foundations of Object-Oriented Programming is defining a Class . In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint for creating an Object. (a data structure). An Object is used like many other Python variables. | A Class has ... a collection of data, these are called Attributes and in Python are pre-fixed using the keyword self | a collection of Functions/Procedures. These are called *Methods when they exist inside a Class definition. | . | An Object is created from the Class/Template. Characteristics of objects ... an Object is an Instance of the Class/Template | there can be many Objects created from the same Class | each Object contains its own Instance Data | the data is setup by the Constructor, this is the &quot;init&quot; method in a Python class | all methods in the Class/Template become part of the Object, methods are accessed using dot notation (object.method()) | . | A Python Class allow for the definition of @ decorators, these allow access to instance data without the use of functions ... @property decorator (aka getter). This enables developers to reference/get instance data in a shorthand fashion (object.name versus object.get_name()) | @name.setter decorator (aka setter). This enables developers to update/set instance data in a shorthand fashion (object.name = &quot;John&quot; versus object.set_name(&quot;John&quot;)) | observe all instance data (self._name, self.email ...) are prefixed with &quot;&quot;, this convention allows setters and getters to work with more natural variable name (name, email ...) | . | .

Explanation . Our group is creating a web arcade/casino where you can earn tokens for the games you play and try to establish yourself on the leader board. Our product name is, &quot;TripleAJ Arcade&quot; . The code above provides backend development which depicts how different gamers will have different scores. The higher the score, the higher you are on the leader board. The code defined its objects, elements, and properties which is our four games and each one&#39;s score as well as the total amount of tokens which is all the points totaled. . My attributes consisted of our four games:ReactionTime, HiLo, Pong, and Snake. My last attribute was the total amount of tokens from all the four games combined. . Vocab . INT Attribute . Initialization:Sets up the initial state of the object. . Self Attribute . When a method is called an object, the first thing passed to the method is basically the object itself. Self is for referring to an object, used in many programming languages. . Setter . Sets the value of a property or a variable of an object. . Getter .

            "content": "Calling Procedures . Slide 1: . A procedure is a named group of programming instructions that may have parameters and return values. | Procedures are referred to by different names, such as method or function, depending on the programing language. | Parameters are input values of a procedure. Arguments specify the values of the parameters when procedure is called. | A procedure call interrupts the sequential execution of statements causing the program to execute the statements within the procedure before continuing. One the last statement in the procedure (or a return statement) has executed, flow or control is returned to the point immediately following where the procedure was called. | . Slide 2: . When calling procedures, it&#39;s important to take notice to whether it returns data, or a block of statements. | If the procedure just returns a block of statements, you call the procedure by referring to the procedure name, and inputting the arguments. | If the procedure returns some sort of data like a boolean or value, then you will assign that value to a variable | . Slide 3: . Assume the Temperature outside is Fahrenheit. | The procedure convertFahrenheit is intended to convert from Fahrenheit to Celsius. | Convert the following psuedocode to python | . def convertFahrenheit (temperature): celsius = temperature - 32 celsius = celsius * 5/9 return celsius outsideTemp = input(&quot;What is the temperature Outside?&quot;) print(convertFahrenheit(int(outsideTemp))) def convertFahrenheit (temperature): celsius = temperature - 32 celsius = celsius * 5/9 return celsius print(&quot;What is the temperature outside?&quot;) outsideTemp = input() . 25.0 What is the temperature outside? . Developing Procedures . Slide 8: . Picking a procedure name is important in case you revisit the code later on (separate words with capitals) There are 2 different types of procedures- ones that return a value and those that simply execute a block of statements Steps of developing procedure: picking a useful name, thinking of parameters (what data does the procedure need to know), making a flowchart or writing procedure in pseudocode, and actually developing the procedure. . Slide 9: . In this example, a teacher is writing a program that will replace the grade on a previous quiz if the new grade is better than the previous. . What would be a good name for this procedure? | What parameters do we need for this procedure? | Try writing this procedure out in python based on the given pseudocode | . currentPoints = int(input(&quot;How many points did you earn on the retake? (Positive integer&quot;)) quizGrade = int(input(&quot;How many points did you earn previously for the quiz? (Positive integer)&quot;)) quizTotal = int(input(&quot;How many points was the quiz out of? (Positive integer&quot;)) def quizReplace(currentPoints, quizGrade, quizTotal): quizGrade = (quizGrade/quizTotal) * 100 currentGrade = currentPoints / quizTotal currentGrade = currentGrade * 100 if (currentGrade &gt; quizGrade): quizGrade = currentGrade return quizGrade print(&quot;Your new grade on the quiz is &quot; + str(int(quizReplace(currentPoints, quizGrade, quizTotal))) + &quot;%&quot;) # inputted: currentPoints = 30 # quizGrade = 25 # quizTotal = 30 . Your new grade on the quiz is 100% . Procedural Abstraction . One type of abstraction is procedural abstraction which provides a name for a process and allows a procedure to be used only knowing what it does and not how it does it | This is very helpful in managing complexity in a program | Subdivision of a program into separate subprograms is called modularity | A procedural abstraction may extract shared features to generalize functionality instead of duplicating code. This allows for program reuse, which helps manage complexity | When a pre-written procedure is called, you don’t necessarily need to know the details of this, just what it does and how to call it | Simply, procedural abstraction is naming and calling a pre-written procedure | Making sure to include the right arguments so the procedure can do what its supposed to do is crucial | . Complexity Example . One of the biggest advantages of procedural abstraction is managing complexity. . Think about the process of simplifying the code? What do you think the advantage of the code segment on the left is? . Code Segment 1 Code Segment 2 . ROTATE_LEFT() | detourLeft() | . MOVE_FORWARD()|turnCorner()| ROTATE_RIGHT |MOVE_FORWARD()| MOVE_FORWARD()|MOVE_FORWARD()| MOVE_FORWARD() ROTATE_RIGHT() MOVE_FORWARD() ROTATE_LEFT() MOVE_FORWARD() ROTATE_LEFT() MOVE_FORWARD() MOVE_FORWARD MOVE_FORWARD() . Hacks . Write a python procedure about something which can help you in school, for example the teacher’s function we spoke about earlier. | Points will be awarded based on creativity and functionality | 0.1 points will be deducted for late submissions | Submit the notes with all blanks filled in (scored out of 0.5 points) and the python procedure (scored out of 0.5 points) by Monday 12/12 at 11:59 PM. | . def get_teacher_feedback(teacher_name, assignment_name): feedback = &quot;Your assignment was well-written and thoroughly researched. Great job!&quot; return feedback print(get_teacher_feedback(&quot;Ms. Smith&quot;, &quot;History project&quot;)) . Your assignment was well-written and thoroughly researched. Great job! . In this example, the get_teacher_feedback() procedure takes in two arguments: the teacher&#39;s name and the name of the assignment. It then retrieves feedback for that assignment from the teacher and returns it. . To call the procedure, we simply call the get_teacher_feedback() function and pass in the appropriate arguments. In this case, we are calling the function with the teacher&#39;s name as &quot;Ms. Smith&quot; and the assignment name as &quot;History project&quot;. When we run the code, the feedback from Ms. Smith for the History project will be printed to the screen. . another example!!!! . def calculate_grade(homework_grades, quiz_grades, test_grades): homework_grade = sum(homework_grades) / len(homework_grades) quiz_grade = sum(quiz_grades) / len(quiz_grades) test_grade = sum(test_grades) / len(test_grades) final_grade = 0.3 * homework_grade + 0.3 * quiz_grade + 0.4 * test_grade return final_grade print(calculate_grade([90, 95, 100], [85, 90, 95], [80, 85, 90])) . 89.5 . To call the procedure, we simply call the calculate_grade() function and pass in the appropriate arguments. In this case, we are calling the function with three lists of grades for the homework, quiz, and test categories. When we run the code, the final grade for the student will be printed to the screen. .",

Sequence of variables | used rto store multiple items in a variable | Ordered and flexible | . sports = [&quot;football&quot;, &quot;hockey&quot;, &quot;baseball&quot;, &quot;basketball&quot;] # change the value &quot;soccer&quot; to &quot;hockey&quot; print (sports) .

[&#39;football&#39;, &#39;soccer&#39;, &#39;golf&#39;, &#39;basketball&#39;] . Iterations . Iteration is the repetition of a process or utterance applied to the result or taken from a previous statement. There&#39;s a lot of types of iteration though, what to use? How do we apply iteration to lists? . Some methods include using a &quot;for loop&quot;, using a &quot;for loop and range()&quot;, using a &quot;while loop&quot;, and using comprehension . Lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets are iterable objects. They are the &#39;containers&#39; that store the data to iterate. . Each of these containers are able to iterate with the iter() command. . There are 2 types of iteration:definite and indefinite. Definite iteration clarifies how many times the loop is going to run, while indefinite specifies a condition that must be met. . When an object is iterable it can be used in an iteration. . When passed through the function iter() it returns an iterator. . Strings, lists, dictionaries, sets and tuples are all examples of iterable objects. . a = [&#39;alpha&#39;, &#39;bravo&#39;, &#39;charlie&#39;] itr = iter(a) print(next(itr)) print(next(itr)) print(next(itr)) . alpha bravo charlie . Loops . Well, above is basically just printing them again, so how do we takes these iterators into something we can make use for? Loops take essentially what we did above and automates it, here are some examples. . list = [&quot;Alpha&quot;, &quot;Bravo&quot;, &quot;Charlie&quot;, &quot;Delta&quot;, &quot;Echo&quot;, &quot;Foxtrot&quot;, &quot;Golf&quot;, &quot;Hotel&quot;, &quot;India&quot;, &quot;Juliett&quot;, &quot;Kilo&quot;, &quot;Lima&quot;, &quot;Mike&quot;, &quot;November&quot;, &quot;Oscar&quot;, &quot;Papa&quot;, &quot;Quebec&quot;, &quot;Romeo&quot;, &quot;Sierra&quot;, &quot;Tango&quot;, &quot;Uniform&quot;, &quot;Victor&quot;, &quot;Whiskey&quot;, &quot;X-ray&quot;, &quot;Yankee&quot;, &quot;Zulu&quot;] # using a for loop for i in list: #for item in the list, print the item print(i) .

The example below is technically correct but conventially 2D arrays are written like below. This is because 2D arrays are meant to be read in 2 dimensions (hence the name). Writing them like below makes them easier to visualize and understand. . keypad = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [&quot; &quot;, 0, &quot; &quot;]] . Conventially 2D arrays are written like below.

            "title": "CPT Final Project Writeup - Pong/Additional Features",
            "content": "Introduction . For this post, you will explore the process of development for the game of pong. one of the four major features of our project: TripleAJ Arcade . Additionally this post will explore and try to fulfill as many CPT requirements issued by CollegeBoard. . This post will also explore the other features we worked on outside of our games as well. . . . Video . . . CPT Submission - 3A . 3.a.i . My program presents an an interactive arcade game called, “Pong” to serve as entertainment for the user. . . 3.a.ii . The user must first pay 10 AJ Tokens (our arcade currency system) in order to play Pong, this will be at the start screen that we decided. . The program allows a user to play ping pong against an AI, there are two paddles constantly hitting a ball to one another. Whoever scores 7 first, wins! . If the user loses, he/she/they have lost 10 tokens from their total balance. If the user wins, they win 15 tokens for beating the AI, the 15 tokens will be added to their balance along with the 10 tokens reimbursed when the user paid to play at the start. This will be seen at the end screen, the user will also have an option to play the game again in efforts to win their tokens back or to simply have fun. . . 3.a.iii . The controls for my game is simply the mouse moving up and down. We believe controlling the mouse is the easiest way to play the game rather than constantly clicking, “W/A/S/D”. . The input for our login system (we discuss this later) is your UID, password, and username. . . CPT Submission - 3B . 3.b.i - Token System Code For Pong . . . 3.b.ii - Removing Tokens . . . 3.b.iii . The variable representing local storage is “tokenAmt”. For the first block, tokenAmt is in 117 and tokenAmt for localstorage in the second blog is found in line 128. . . 3.b.iv . The information that is saved in the local storage as tokenAmt is crucial for the program to function properly. It indicates the total number of tokens that the user possesses, which is required for carrying out mathematical operations to update the token balance after the user has played the game and earned more tokens based on their performance. Therefore, this data plays a key role in the proper functioning of the program. . . 3.b.v . The current use of local storage in the program is a reliable and efficient method for storing and updating the user’s token balance. This approach allows for easy retrieval and modification of data, making it a simple and effective way to manage the user’s token balance. However, an alternative approach could involve fetching the user’s token balance every time the game requires an update. This alternative approach would not be as efficient, as it would require more computing power and would be less convenient to update. Therefore, local storage is the preferred option, as it offers a more streamlined and efficient solution to managing the user’s token balance. . . CPT Submission - 3C . 3.c.i . . 3.c.ii . . . 3.c.iii . The first code block demonstrates a function called “collision” that accepts two parameters “b” and “p”. The function is used to detect a collision between a ball and a paddle in the game of Pong. . To achieve this, the function determines the top, bottom, left, and right positions of both the ball and the paddle and checks for overlapping positions between them. The function returns a Boolean value indicating whether a collision has occurred or not, based on the four boundaries of the ball and paddle. . This function plays a crucial role in the Pong game mechanics as it enables the game to detect and respond to collisions between the ball and paddle objects. The use of this function is an example of procedural abstraction, as it abstracts away the details of the collision detection process, allowing the programmer to focus on other aspects of the game development. . The second code block checks for collisions between the ball and the player paddle in the game of Pong, using a “collision” function. If a collision is detected, the code plays a sound effect, calculates the point of collision, and uses it to determine the angle of reflection for the ball using different functions. It then determines the direction of the ball based on which half of the paddle it collided with, updates the velocity of the ball with the new angle and direction, and increases its speed to simulate acceleration. . . 3.c.iv - Selection, Iteration, Sequencing . This code has sequencing because it executes a series of steps in a particular order to render the game of Pong on the canvas. First, it clears the canvas using the “drawRect” function with a black color. Then, it draws the user’s score on the left side of the canvas and the computer opponent’s score on the right side of the canvas using the “drawText” function. . After that, it draws the net using the “drawNet” function, which can be seen as a dotted line that is constantly looping and resetting after every score, this is shown as iteration. . Next, it draws the user’s paddle and the computer opponent’s paddle using the “drawRect” function with their respective properties. Finally, it draws the ball using the “drawArc” function with its position and radius. Through what I explained just now, there is selection in the function render() code block as it uses conditional statements to decide which direction the ball will move and whether the player or the computer has scored. . . CPT Submission - 3D . . 3.d.i - Calls for CRUD . Create: When a new user registers on your website, a POST call is made to the backend to create a new user account. The user provides their email address and a password, which are stored in the backend database. The server then generates a unique user ID and returns it to the client as a response. . Read: When a user logs in to your website, a GET call is made to the backend to retrieve their account information. The server checks the user’s email and password against the database, and if the credentials are valid, the server returns the user’s account information (including their current token balance) to the client. . Update: When a user updates their password, a PUT call is made to the backend to update the user’s account information in the database. The user provides their old password and a new password, and the server checks that the old password is valid before updating the user’s account information with the new password. . Delete: If a user chooses to delete their account, a DELETE call is made to the backend to delete the user’s account information from the database.

First you type in: $ virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3 webapp . Then type: $ source webapp/bin/activate . Step 2 . PORTS!!! . Run sudo docker ps | You should see a huge list of ports regarding your project name. . Select a port that is not in use, anything in the 8000s. . Then go to your backend repo, this is your flask. . Make sure your Dockerfile matches what it says below: . Now Type in sudo docker-compose up in your terminal . After that type in the link in your browser: something like https://localhost:PORTNUMBER.. if this works, push your changes and your good. . Step 3 . AWS!!! .

Long ago, I remember being amazed that Red Hat was not selling its Linux distribution, they were giving away the software. They had to! This was in the terms of the licenses they were using, GPL.

They rose in fortune, became a public company, and had an amazing Initial Public Offering (IPO). Many, many vendors have followed the Red Hat model in building free distributions and establishing unique business models. Qualcomm figured out how to mix Patent and GPL businesses and have flourished since abandoning all proprietary, to include Android in its very complicated business model using Android. .

The advancement of computer technology has enabled us to achieve greater productivity, efficiency, and access to educational resources. On one hand, this has revolutionized the way we live and work, with faster communication, data processing, and problem-solving capabilities. However, it has also led to job automation and a decrease in employment opportunities. Furthermore, the internet and computer technology have provided a greater level of connectivity and globalization, bridging geographical and cultural divides. This has enabled collaboration and understanding between people from different backgrounds, but has also contributed to the spread of hate speech, cyber-bullying, and a decrease in face-to-face interactions.

Potential con of our project: . It may be slightly buggy (it was developed by high schoolers) | . Dopamine issues: . Modern technology has led to a lot more issues of people, especially teens, being desensitized to dopamine. This is why dopamine detox lifestyles are common in people who want to better themselves. Nowadays things like social media provide people with dopamine with the simple action of a scroll from one 15 second video to another. This is also one reason why the attention span of people has decreased to under 10 seconds. . To combat this, content creators have adapted their products to amuse the viewer within those 10 seconds, giving the viewer a boost of dopamine that otherwise would not have happened. These continuous boosts of dopamine pose a problem with the desensitization of dopamine among teens and may explain the increased rates of depression and anxiety in Gen Z kids.

This value can be used in our program to construct a leaderboard of players with the highest number of tokens in order to create a more competitive experience. We will also store a UserID, Name, and Password to identify users on the leaderboard and authenticate their account. | . Managing Complexity | Shows a collection of data that manages complexity. Explains an alternative method that would have been more complex and explains why that method could not be used or how it would have to be written differently. | There will be many alternative ways to track currency or program each game, so we will show how we chose the simplest way to achieve the desired functionality and explain how it could have been done another way. | . Procedural Abstraction | Shows a student-developed procedure with at least one parameter that has an effect on the functionality of the procedure, and shows where that procedure is called. Describes how the procedure contributes to the functionality of the program. | This will be found in each game that we develop, as all of our games are complex enough to require a function with a parameter. | . Algorithm Implementation | Includes a student-developed algorithm that includes sequencing, selection, and iteration. Explains how the algorithm works in detail enough to where someone could recreate it. | The games that we develop for the virtual arcade will have sufficient algorithms to fit this criteria. | . Testing | Describe two calls to the selected procedure in response 3c. Each call must pass a argument that causes different outputs. Describes conditions being tested by each call. Identifies the result of each call. | We will test two different features in each game, which test certain conditions and output different results. | . Create Performance Task . Each person in our group is programming a game for the arcade, so each person’s CPT will be focused on their respective game. This all will be incorporated into a larger N@TM project, which is the entire arcade itself with an account, currency, and leader board system. . We also might add more games and features with those games so that the user does not get bored. . Code Plan . Pong will be coded with HTML/CSS/JS. . The user pays 15 tokens to start the game | They are prompted with a basic overview of the game, as follows: Each round lasts 5 minutes | You must score as much as possible | Every time a user scores, they will earn 10 tokens. If the user wins, they win 50 tokens. | . | The user’s score will be recorded on the leader board. | Video Plan . I plan to make Pong 5 minutes long. You must pay 20 tokens to play pong, and every time you score, you win 10 points. If you win the match, you win 50 tokens. .",

Hacks . The Big Picture purpose of this hack is to build a database. Being able to create an SQLite table and populate test data within it is the major goal. To do this effectively it is imperative to show the following. . Build Schema for a table, make a new model file and use users.py as an example. Start slow and simple and build up. | Build an initXXXXX() method and use it to add preliminary/test data to the table. Once again use users.py as an example. | Make a 30-60 second video where you show a Debugging session of making new rows in the table. Use sqlite marketplace tools and/or sqlite3 command line tool to show success in creating table and adding data. | Hack Helper . Here are some tips. . Become familiar with initUsers(). Observe it is called/activated from main.py. This function activates after you run the main.py and activate the web application in the browser. Observe that the sqlite.db file will appear in the volumes directory in conjunction with home screen of site appearing in browser. . | Delete sqlite.db from volumes directory on your development machine. Set breakpoint on initUsers() and run main.py using debug. Use the step into option on the debugger and observe the creation of data. . | . @app.before_first_request def activate_job():initJokes() initUsers() . Make your own XXXXX.py file under model directory. Follow users.py and develop your own schema from the OOP code you did in last Hacks. Follow the pattern in users.py to make a initXXXX() function top populate some test data. . | In main.py, add your initXXXX() method to def activate_job() function shown above. Use this as basis of your video debugging session. Debugging is hugely important at this level to understand your database success prior to building an API. Building initXXXX() method, adding database records, and debugging will enable you to verify CRUD operations as you develop. . | . Completed Hacks .

An algorithm is essentially just a conceptually generalized solution to a problem that may be later used in the actual world, such as a computer program. Interface for Application Programs An API is a collection of procedures, protocols, and instruments used to create software applications. The interaction between software components is defined by an API. The programming of graphical user interface (GUI) components also uses APIs. . def get_even_numbers(numbers: List[int]) -&gt; List[int]: even_numbers = [] for number in numbers: if number % 2 == 0: even_numbers.append(number) return even_numbers . .

One of the lowest levels of abstraction employs a base-2 numeric system that only uses combinations of the digits zero and one. Because they only use zeros and ones for data storage and computation, computers only work in binary. In boolean logic, a single binary digit can stand in for True (1) or False (0), but many binary digits can be combined to store enormous amounts of data and carry out intricate operations. Computers convert between binary and the real data you need, such numbers and . def decimal_to_binary(n: int) -&gt; str: binary_digits = [] while n &gt; 0: binary_digits.append(n % 2) n = n // 2 return &quot;&quot;.join(str(d) for d in binary_digits[::-1]) . .

Only applicable when the list is sorted, this search technique finds the location of a target value within a sorted array by continually halving the search interval. The amount of effort needed to discover an object rises considerably more slowly with Binary Search than with Sequential Search due to its divide-and-conquer strategy. With this logarithmic tendency, in reality. . def binary_search(arr: List[int], target: int) -&gt; int: low = 0 high = len(arr) - 1 while low &lt;= high: mid = (low + high) // 2 if target &lt; arr[mid]: high = mid - 1 # Narrow the search range to the lower half elif target &gt; arr[mid]: low = mid + 1 # Narrow the search range to the upper half else: return mid # Return the index of the target element return -1 . .

Libraries . A library in computer science is a collection of non-volatile data that a program may often access to create new software. Due to the fact that you do not have to manually link routines to every application that utilizes them, libraries are particularly helpful for storing frequently used functions. When the linker cannot find a procedure elsewhere, it automatically searches libraries for it. Data, documentation, message templates, pre-written code, classes, and values are examples of resources that may be found in libraries. . import math x = math.sqrt(9) print(x) # prints 3.0 y = math.sin(math.pi / 2) print(y) # prints 1.0 import random data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] random.choice(data) . 3.0 1.0 . 4 . .

Lossless Data Compression . When a file is compressed without any loss of quality, all of the original data is still present when the file is decompress. The information has been fully recovered. This method is typically used for text or spreadsheet files where the loss of words or financial information might be problematic. A format for images that offers lossless compression is PNG. . compressed_data = zlib.compress(data) decompressed_data = zlib.decompress(compressed_data) assert data == decompressed_data . . Lossy compression . Reduces a file by permanently removing certain data, particularly superfluous data. Upon file uncompression, just a portion of the original data remains (although the user may not notice it). Lossy compression is typically employed for video and sound since most users won&#39;t notice a certain degree of information loss.

The purpose of this lesson is to introduce students to the concept of undecidable problems in computer science and to explain why these problems are important. . Key vocabulary: . Decision problem | Decidable problem | Undecidable problem | . Decision Problem . A decision problem is a problem in computer science and mathematics that can be solved by a yes-no answer, also known as a binary answer. In other words, a decision problem is a problem for which there are only two possible outputs:&quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;. There are two types of decision problems that Collegeboard goes over: . Decidable Problems | Undecidable Problems | . A decidable is a problem in computer science and mathematics for which an algorithm can be created that can always produce a correct answer or solution. In other words, a decidable problem is a problem for which there exists an algorithm that can be used to determine whether a given input is a valid solution or not. . An undecidable problem is a problem in computer science and mathematics for which it is impossible to create an algorithm that can always provide a correct answer or solution. This means that it is not possible for an algorithm to always determine whether a given input is a valid solution to an undecidable problem. . Decidable Problems . A decidable problem is an algorithm that can always have an output of yes or no given any input. It is always correct. . Example of a Decidable Problem . The procedure below tests to see if a number is divisible by 13. If it is, it returns true. If it isn&#39;t, it returns false. . def divideThirteen(number): if number % 13 == 0: return True else: return False print(divideThirteen(26)) print(divideThirteen(30)) . True False . Undecidable Problems . An Example of a Forever Running Code . The code keeps adding 1 to the variable number until number is no longer an integer(This is not the python data type &quot;integer&quot;, it&#39;s the integer in number theory). However, there is no end to this code, making the computer run forever. There is no halt to the code. . i = 0 number = 1 def integerTest(n): # Testing if the number is an integer if n%1 ==0: return True else: return False # Using while loop to keep searching an a non-integer above 1.

The Halting Problem . The halting problem is an example of an undecidable problem. It states that it is not always possible to correctly determine whether a code halts or runs forever. . There is no way to write an algorithm to analyze and determine whether a body of code can run forever or not. . Halting Problem Example: . In order to understand this, suppose that an algorithm was able to analyze whether a code halts or not. Let&#39;s call this algorithm HaltChecker. | HaltChecker analyzes the program,program P, and its input,input I. If program P halts with input I, HaltChecker returns an output of &quot;halts&quot;. If program P doesn&#39;t halt(runs forever) with input I, HaltChecker returns an output of &quot;never&quot;. For example, in the code where it tests if variable number, the code runs forever, so HaltChecker returns an output of never. | Then, we add another algorithm called Reverser which reverses HaltChecker&#39;s output. So, if &quot;never&quot; is the output of HaltChecker, then the output of Reverser is halts. It&#39;s also the same the other way around: if HaltChecker has an output of &quot;halts&quot;, then Reverser has an output of never. | We combine these algorithms into one entire body of code. | Since Reverser is the algorithm at the end, hence giving the ultimate output, notice how it prints &quot;never&quot; when in fact there is an end(As proved by HaltChecker), and how it also prints &quot;halts&quot; when there is in fact is no end to the code(Also proved by HaltChecker). As a result, HaltChecker is inaccurate and this is an undecidable problem. | . This Diagram Sums up the Entire Process in the Bulleted List: . Credits of diagram and example to Khan Academy . FAQ . Q: If Reverser is causing the problem, why not remove it? | A: Removing Reverser will remove the problems, however, we are looking for ways which create the problem of not outputting a correct result. One example is enough to prove that it is an undecidable problem since it proves that the code is not completely accurate. | . Extra Things to Notice . Note that while a computer may take a long time to run a section of code, it does not mean that the computer is going to run forever. | Humans are able to solve some undecidable problems. The entire Halting Problem example was to prove that computers cannot solve undecidable problems. | . Hacks . Come up with one situation in which a computer runs into an undecidable problem. Explain why it is considered an undecidable problem. . . 3.17 Homework . Your homework for Algorithmic Efficiency is pretty simple. . Use the 1st code below and graph it (Desmos, TI Inpire Cas, e.t.c), change the x value only! | Label the number of loops done as x and the time (microseconds) to find the index as y | Connect the points | Do the same thing with the 2nd code | Compare the two graphs and explain which one of the two is more efficient and why (min. 2 sentences) | Insert images of the graph either in your blog or on review ticket | Hacks . QUILLBOT THIS One situation in which a computer may run into an undecidable problem is when trying to determine if a given program will run forever or eventually halt. This is known as the halting problem, and it is considered undecidable in python (and any other general-purpose programming language) because it is impossible to determine, using a finite number of steps, whether a program will halt or run forever. . To understand why the halting problem is undecidable, consider a simple program that takes a single input, which is the name of another program, and attempts to determine whether that program will halt or run forever when given the same input. If the program being examined halts, then our original program will also halt. However, if the program being examined runs forever, our original program will also run forever, because it will be stuck in an infinite loop trying to determine whether the other program will halt. This means that our original program cannot determine, using a finite number of steps, whether the other program will halt or run forever. . In conclusion, the halting problem is undecidable in python because it is impossible for a program to determine, using a finite number of steps, whether another program will halt or run forever. This is a fundamental limitation of all general-purpose programming languages, and it is one of the reasons why some problems are considered &quot;undecidable&quot; in these languages. . import time def linear_search(lst, x): start_time = time.perf_counter_ns() # records time (nanoseconds) for i in range(len(lst)): # loops through the entire list if lst[i] == x: # until the x value we are looking for is found end_time = time.perf_counter_ns() # records time again total_time = (end_time - start_time) // 1000 # subtracts last recorded time and first recorded time print(&quot;Found element after {} loops in {} microseconds&quot;.format(i+1, total_time)) # prints the results return print(&quot;Your number was found at&quot;, i) end_time = time.perf_counter_ns() # records the time again total_time = (end_time - start_time) // 1000 # subtracts last recorded time and first recorded time print(&quot;Element not found after {} loops in {} microseconds&quot;.format(len(lst), total_time)) # prints the results return &quot;Your number wasn&#39;t found :(&quot; lst = list(range(1, 10001)) # list with numbers 1-10000 x = 5000 # replace with an integer between 1 and 10000 (I suggest big numbers like 500, 2000, so on) linear_search(lst, x) # runs procedure . import time def binary_search(lt, x): start_time = time.perf_counter_ns() # starts timer low = 0 # sets the lower side mid = 0 # sets mid value high = len(lt) -1 # sets the higher side num_loops = 0 # number of loops the search undergoes to find the x value while low&lt;=high: # Loop ran until mid is reached num_loops += 1 # adds one loop each time process is repeated mid = (low + high) // 2 # takes the lowest and highest possible numbers and divides by 2 and rounds to closest whole # if lt[mid] == x: end_time = time.perf_counter_ns() # records time total_time = (end_time - start_time) // 1000 # time in microseconds print(&quot;Element found after {} loops in {} microseconds&quot;.format(num_loops, total_time)) # prints the results return mid # returns the index value elif lt[mid] &gt; x: # if mid was higher than x value, then sets new highest value as mid -1 high = mid -1 elif lt[mid] &lt; x: low = mid + 1 # if mid was lower than x, sets the new low as mid + 1 end_time = time.perf_counter_ns() total_time = (end_time - start_time) // 1000 print(&quot;Element not found after {} loops in {} microseconds&quot;.format(num_loops, total_time)) # prints the results return &quot;Your number wasn&#39;t found :(&quot; lt = list(range(1, 10001)) # list with numbers 1-10000 x = 149 # replace with an integer between 1 and 10000 (I suggest big numbers like 500, 2000, so on) binary_search(lt, x) # runs procedure .

Kathyleen Beveridge is a high-tech professional at Qualcomm, she earned her bachelor&#39;s degree at Santa Clara, where she pursued finance and became an investment banker. She soon did not like the work that she was doing with mergers and acquisitions and so she earned her masters degree at USC. Kathyleen’s favorite poet is Maya Angelou, she looks up to her as a role model. Kathyleen worked at HP as well. High-tech influenced Kathyleen because it had a macro/global impact for the services she was developing with her colleagues (for example, every day 1 billion people benefited from Qualcomm). Katyleen worked at Qualcomm and eventually became director of sales operations, she worked at Qualcomm for 14 years. Katyleen now works at Thermo Scientific Fisher, which has 100,000 employees and billions of dollars in revenue. Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. is an American supplier of scientific instrumentation, reagents and consumables, and software services. . Kathyleen is the senior director of marketing and global commerce at Thermo Fisher Scientific, her job is to attract clients and grow the company overall in terms of business and sales. Kathyleen speaks about the voice of sales and how anyone can develop a concept and build it in a way where it can impact the world in a different way. . Kris Porter is a software engineer who specializes in DevOps and infrastructure engineering. Kris enrolled at UCLA for electrical engineering for a Bachelor&#39;s degree. Kris didn’t know anything about coding and even failed his CS class in his second semester at UCLA, he ended up retaking and soon would go on to like computer science. Kris graduated when the stock market crashed in 2008 so it was really hard to find a job. Kris did his masters degree at CSU Los Angeles and took his first job as a systems engineer at Griffith Park Media. He took on another job at NBC in which he was responsible for the operation and maintenance of production servers and edit stations. Kris joined a startup at LocationSmart in which he was a DevOps engineer where he was responsible for mostly engineering duties and operations. Mr. Mort then hired Kris and he worked at Qualcomm as a senior software engineer where he expertised on several different concepts such as user experience. Kris worked at Twitter for 2 years. One of Kris’s projects was network info mechanical systems which used robotics and AI to create a cool sensor reading. Kris also learned Linux. . Kris learned about python, data structures, machine learning and deep learning, CCNA, and Twitter University. Some other projects Kris worked on was an analytics infrastructure protocol. Some of his Twitter projects include building a new data center and working on GraphQL.Kris is now pursuing a web3 infrastructure startup which leads him into a new direction in his career. . I also learned about how interviewing is the hardest part in the tech world, we often need to present ourselves in a manner that can help us get a good job. I learned about agile methodology and also how business and technology often interconnect. I hope too use what I learned from this lesson to help me grow my career and gain insight on what I can do in the future! .",

This simulation is made in order to simulate movement on a 2d plane vs a 3d plane. . | How it works: we have multiple variables, if statements and equations under a while command in order to randomy generate steps on a 2d plane. Once it reaches the set destination, it will say that the man made it home after x amount of steps. . | For the 3D plane, it takes a lot longer due to how big and open the 3d environment is, so there are more if statements in the 3d plane . | .

Simulations in the wild . Simulations are used extremely frequently in real life applications. One of the most common examples of simulations are video games. A games physics engine can accurately simulate objects colliding . Another example is Blender, the software used in 3d animations class, here at Del Norte. Blender is made up of many small simulations, but one big one it uses is simulating the way light bounces off of and interacts with objects. . HW !!! . Create a simulation. It can be anything, just has to simulate something. . Some ideas: . Two objects colliding | Gravity on other planets | . AND .

A library is a collection of precompiled codes that can be used later on in a program for some specific well-defined operations. | These precompiled codes can be referred to as modules. Each module contains bundles of code that can be used repeatedly in different programs. | A library may also contain documentation, configuration data, message templates, classes, and values, etc. | . Why are libraries important? . Using Libraries makes Python Programming simpler and convenient for the programmer. | One example would be through looping and iteration, as we don’t need to write the same code again and again for different programs. | Python libraries play a very vital role in fields of Machine Learning, Data Science, Data Visualization, etc. | . A few libraries that simplify coding processes: . Pillow allows you to work with images. | Tensor Flow helps with data automation and monitors performance. | Matplotlib allows you to make 2D graphs and plots. | . The AP Exam Refrence Sheet itself is a library! . Hacks: . Research two other Python Libraries NOT DISCUSSED DURING LESSON and make a markdown post, explaining their function and how it helps programmers code. . API&#8217;s . An Application Program Interface, or API, contains specific direction for how the procedures in a library behave and can be used. | An API acts as a gateway for the imported procedures from a library to interact with the rest of your code. | . Activity: Walkthrough with NumPy . Install NumPy on VSCode: Open New Terminal In VSCode: pip3 install --upgrade pip pip install numpy . REMEMBER: When running library code cells use Python Interpreter Conda (Version 3.9.12) . Example of using NumPy for arrays: . import numpy as np new_matrix = np.array([[1, 2, 3],[4, 5, 6],[7, 8, 9]]) print (new_matrix) . [[1 2 3] [4 5 6] [7 8 9]] . Example of using NumPy for derivatives: . import numpy as np # defining polynomial function var = np.poly1d([2, 1]) print(&quot;Polynomial function, f(x):&quot;, var) # calculating the derivative derivative = var.deriv() print(&quot;Derivative, f(x)&#39;=&quot;, derivative) # calculates the derivative of after # given value of x print(&quot;When x=5 f(x)&#39;=&quot;, derivative(5)) . Polynomial function, f(x): 2 x + 1 Derivative, f(x)&#39;= 2 When x=5 f(x)&#39;= 2 . Random Values . Random number generation (RNG) produces a random number (crazy right?) This means that a procedure with RNG can return different values even if the parameters (inputs) do not change | . | CollegeBoard uses RANDOM(A, B), to return an integer between integers A and B. RANDOM(1, 10) can output 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 | In Python, this would be random.randint(A, B), after importing Python&#39;s &quot;random&quot; library (import random) | JavaScript&#39;s works a little differently, with Math.random() returning a value between 0 and 1. To match Python and CollegeBoard, you could make a procedure like this | . | . | . CollegeBoard Example: What is the possible range of values for answ3 . Convert the following procedure to Python, then determine the range of outputs if n = 5. . PROCEDURE Dice(n) sum ← 0 REPEAT UNTIL n = 0 sum ← sum + RANDOM(1, 6) n ← n - 1 RETURN sum . import random # Fill in the blank def Dice(n): sum = 0 while n != 0: sum = sum + random.randint(1, 6) n = n - 1 return sum Dice(5) # Will output a range of 5 to 30 . 17 . Homework .

            "content": "Variables, Assignments, Data Abstraction . A variable is an abstraction that can hold inside a program and hold the value. Changex Contains three parts: . Name | Value | Type | . Name variables are short and not as specific. Do not make your code for variables too complicated because it can become messy. However, do not make your variables too vague. . Types of data: . Integer | Text/string | Boolean | . Strings consist of a key word, the second variables would be considered as integers as it would display a number. The third variable would be a boolean because it shows if anything is true or false. . A list of data can also be stored in variables. This is useful as it can print/retrieve specific values n the list without creating lots of variables. . Assignments . Operators that allow the program to change the value represented by a variable. . Some operators: . = (assigns both right and left) (a=b) | += (a+b=ab) | -= (a-b=a-b) | and so on | . The value stored in a variable will be the most recent value assigned. . Changing Values: Change any value, but the most recent value will be the output. . Data Abstraction . Data abstraction is a method used in coding to represent data in useful forms in applicable scenarios. . Data abstraction has tools likes variables and lists which are very important. . Lists and Strings . A list is an ordered sequence of elements, an element is a specific value in that list to a unique index. An index is a reference to the elements in the string. . A string is a ordered sequence of characters. . Example of a list: EXAMPLE - WE USE COLORS: . colorsList=[&quot;pink&quot;, &quot;yellow&quot;, &quot;green&quot;, &quot;blue, &quot;orange&quot;, &quot;purple&quot;] . print(colorsList) . ^ Now it will print the colors and the list you defined along with the specific colors, which are the elements. . NOTE: Index always starts at ONE on AP Exam . Managing Complexity . Makes code more clear | Updates data easily | . There is only one other way for interchanging data between lists, and that is to completely overwrite previous data in the list. .

            "content": "Final Score: Took about an hour to 1 hour 15 mins. . Overall . Overall I scored 45/50, I was aiming for this score because it satisfied a 5 on the AP scale. Moreover, Mr. Mortensen said how the students who did best and reflected on their work all got very nice internships, something that I am aiming for. . Test Corrections . Question 15 | . I chose C, because I thought users would provide documentation for program code. This is wrong however, because users are unlikely to have the expertise needed to understand and provide documentation for program code. . D is the correct answer, because users ca help for design and development. . Question 34 | . I chose D because I thought combining all three lists would make sense. This is incorrect. . B is the correct answer because the code segment intializes firstList to contain the first three, so the code segment then swaps the contents of firstList and secondList by assigning firstList to thirdList, and so on, and so on, like third to second. . Question 36 | . I chose B because I thought it was initialized to 0 instead of 1. The correct answer is C because it is initialized to 1m so it would be 13,15,17,19,21 . Question 44 | . I guessed on this and chose B, this is incorrect because for any integer, the value of MOD 2 is either 0 or 1. . The correct answer is C because 23/3 has a remainder of two, so 3 is the correct option. . Question 46 | . I chose D because I thought that when the third statements assigns the value of first, the fourth would assign the second making it also false. . This is incorrect , I simply chose false instead of true but the graphic show that is asks for the true variable and Option A is correct because it specifies the true variable for both first and second value. . Strengths and Weakness . I had a tough time with observational questions which were questions that involved loops and arrays and much more. Also some binary question were hard. . | I had a good time guessing and doing good on binary questions. I also understood and answered user interface questions correctly and communications affecting a project questions. . | . Test Explanations, why I chose what I chose . For Question 1, I chose D because the loop is repeating 3 times which makes sense for the code segment to be multiplied by three or cubed. | For Question 2, it was just an observational question, when x is negative, y is assigned the value true and value of y is displayed. | For Question 3, I figured software testing is always going to be needed even if there is good communication. | For Question 4, observing member list for food allergies and dietary restrictions. | For Question 5, Brandon’s list is not needed. | For Question 6, the value of count is displayed in the loop which is then split into 1s, so all odd integers are printed. | For Question 7, the code segment adds x and y and then divides x. | For Question 8, the difference between numList and newList is that the elements j and k are interchanged. | For Question 9, 3-7 reduces the score if it is not set to 0. | For Question 10, having no communication would probably screw up the entire project. | For Question 11, the algorithm uses myList for 2 loops, the outerloops uses the first element in the list which corresponds to the second to last question. | For Question 12, the information is provided by the restaurant, not the customer. | For Question 13, the list does not only have positive values, the loop returns when it hits a positive value and returns when it hits a negative value. | For Question 14, check minus is displayed for 8 and 6, both in between 7 at the top. | For Question 16, each packet contains data to be transmitted, so I figured that each packet would be reassembled by the recipients device itself. | Question 17, protocols follow a set of rules, D makes the most sense, | Question 18, C made the most sense to me, because it said the word network. | Question 19, 1111 is the max for four bits, which is equal to 15. 15+14=29, so its an overflow I guess. | Question 20, I figured four bits would be 2 to the 4th power, which is 16. | Question 21, 1 2 and 3 make all sense, binary is everything in Computer Science :) | Question 22, I figured this is binary mathematics, I’m going to be honest, I guessed on this one, | Question 23, analog data has values that change a lot. So the samples are represented digitally, so I chose D because it talks about sequence of bits. | Question 24, binary mathematics again | Question 25, age is a number, number makes sense. | Question 26, true or false option, boolean? | Question 27, string makes the best sense for a student name. | Question 28, units used is about 25 or less, the cost is times the number of units. I just used math for this. Question 29, lists are data, so list makes allowing to insert data. | Question 30, numeric data is also good for lists. | Question 31, I guessed h, but it make sense because index 3 has ghi, and the second letter of ghi is h. | Question 32, it says yourlist equals mylist, so 10,30,50,70 equals 10,30,50,70. | Question 33, it says greater than or equal to 90, and left to right. | Question 35, maxPS to 50 by default, if statements were confusing tho but I just chose A and D. | Question 37, the values keep interchanging, and num1 has to equal num2 and temp has to equal both. But it would make sense for the second statement to be in the middle. | Question 38, same reasoning as last question. | Question 39, hello would not make sense, also negative numbers would not make any sense for lists, it was between 2.5 or 4, but 2.5 had a decimal, so I chose 4. | Question 40, 3-5=-2 | Question 41, q is 20, p is q so p is 20, r is q so r is 20, r is p so r is once again 20. | Question 42, IF blocks make up 8+4+4=16 | Question 43, integer is based at 0 and exceeds 5 when the loop is eliminated, so 10 or 15 makes sense, I guessed 15, | Question 45, match the lists, the list contains 2 positive values, so count1 is count2 and count2 is 3. | Question 47, I did the math for each and then put them in order. | Question 48, both x and z have the value of 50 so I chose C. | Question 49, well on backwards is no so no+on = noon. | Question 50, first name goes first so I chose A, and last names goes second, which is why I chose A. | .",

What is the inputted data? . The program’s input will be the different factors that change a student’s chance of getting into an Ivy league. We will be focusing on the following factors: . | Intended major | GPA | SAT/ACT scores | Gender | Ethnicity | Extra Cirriculars | Clubs | Essay | Leadership | . How are we going to do this . The output of the program will be in the format of a percentage chance of getting accepted into each ivy league college. . Brown University | Columbia University | Cornell University | Dartmouth University | Harvard University | Princeton University | University of Pennsylvania | Yale University | . Project Concept (continued): . Furthermore, to get an accurate output, data from multiple sources will be used for each college, primarily acceptance rate data over the past 5 years for each college, based on the student data mentioned previously. . Frontend: Design Methodology . We need to make a aesthetic design, we are going to use bootstrap in synthesis with the normal HTML and CSS. . . Program Purpose: To assign the right college for each person and determine if they can get into an ivy league. | Data Abstraction: Task the right variables, organize colleges coherently. | Managing Complexity: Since we plan on using an API in our project, this means that we will be handling a lot of data, hence organization is required. We plan on doing this with lists and dictionaries to create and format our API in key-value pairs. This will be crucial to the function, organization, and efficiency of our project. | Procedural Abstraction: The search engine will be able to narrow down the results of the different colleges the user may get into. | Algorithm: We are going to create a function that takes user inputs and compares them to a list of data that we have from the API. | Testing: Single tests that we can perform on our project can include individually testing each function. That way we don’t code everything, mess up and struggle to find the error later. | . Backend Program . We are going to use Jupyter notebooks . We will use JS and Python. .

Functionality: The quiz is built around three simple MC questions that have an input and output, if you get it right, you have a correct screen as an output, if you get it wrong, you have an incorrect screen as an output. The FRQ is also like that, and has one or two responses as correct answers which leads to two different outputs. . FRQ Design . . Successes . Quiz functions properly | Inputs and outputs are well connected | Quiz is visually appealing | Quiz achieves the goal to educate about sports | . Discoveries . Some things we discovered: .

I decided to plan my quiz as a sports quiz, in which each question would specifically ask about an individual sport and a prominent player/team for the sport. My other team members also decided to make a quiz for the sport they play. A vital step to creating this quiz was to utilize the “onDemand” code, along with, “setscreen”, these commands were important for switching screens for every button that is clicked. . For my quiz specifically, I decided to include multiple choice questions as well as one free response question and a choice question which consists of a dropdown menu. After that, I started off with an NFL question, an NBA question, a NHL question, as well as questions about Cricket and Tennis. . I had a fun time thinking about how I was going to design my quiz, and eventually after I decided what to do, I got to coding and tried to add unique elements to my quiz that would make it way more different. . . Daily Group Plans . For daily plans, we decided to create a group chat and message each other of what we were planning to add to our quiz. . By doing this, we also got ideas on how to visually make our quiz look better as well as what else I could possibly add to my quiz. . Planning Steps . Steps before coding: .

            "content": "STUDY THIS: . https://quizlet.com/535655479/biogeochemical-cycles-flash-cards/ . 1.4 Carbon Cycles Part 1: . Ecosystems are result of biotic and abiotic interactions . The carbon cycle is the movement of atoms and molecules containing the element carbon between sources and sinks . Some cycles barely take any time, others take millions! . It is one of the biogeochemical cycle, that means it is self-regulating and naturally occurring movement of chemical molecules through various sources and sinks (reservoirs) . Biogeochemical cycles stabilize and regulate the flow of matter through ecosystems . Biogeochemical cycles can be disrupted by human activity . Carbon Cycle: . In the atmosphere, carbon is found as CO2, we need to move it in the ecosystem, so we use photosynthesis. Photosynthesis transformed the CO2 into glucose, the opposite of photosynthesis is cellular respiration. . The process of decomposition can return CO2 to the atmosphere. Plants, organisms, etc die. During decomposition, CO2 can go down into the soil or deeper into the ocean. . Limestone is the bedrock for many terrestrial ecosystems. . Carbon that gets stored. Gets stored into producers and consumers. . Fossil carbons, fossilized remains of plants and animals, can be in terrestrial aquatic environments. It is a geologic long term deposit of carbon. The process of extraction and combustion results in CO2 being added into the atmosphere, which would disrupt the carbon cycle. . Reservoir Interactions: . Fast carbon cycling: . Fast carbon cycling is largely the movement of carbon compounds through the biosphere (the living organisms on Earth) . | This type of cycling is driven by the cellular metabolism of producers in ecosystems . | . The main biological processes involved in fast carbon cycling are photosynthesis and cellular respiration . | . For fast carbon cycling, the primary carbon reservoir is the atmosphere . | . The length of time a carbon compound spends in the atmosphere is relatively brief . | . Decomposition into more detail: . Return CO2 to the atmosphere through cellular respiration . | Return carbon to the soil or water through breakdown of sugars in the bodies they are decomposing . | . Sedimentation and burial: Organic material can result in a much longer sequestration of carbon compounds. Once the carbon is buried, it is essentially removed from the fast carbon cycle. . Deep ocean sediments and fossil carbon (coal, oil, natural gas) are the largest reservoirs of carbon…and these are the result of sedimentation and burial. . Long term carbon reservoirs can return to cycling via fossil fuel extraction and combustion . And uplift and weathering of limestone. . Carbon is released to the atmosphere when fossil fuels are burned (combustion). Carbon is released into the atmosphere during respiration. . . Photosynthesis removes carbon from the atmosphere . | Sedimentation and burial . | The process of burning combustion results in carbon being released into the atmosphere . | Decomposition returns CO2 back to the atmosphere in the carbon cycle . | . The Nitrogen Cycle: . . Nitrogen Fixation - through the process of lightning or bacteria since N2 cannot be used by several organisms. So N2 is converted into another type of Nitrogen. . Nitrification - Nitrification is a process that converts ammonia and similar nitrogen compounds into nitrite (NO2–) and then nitrate (NO3–). Nitrification can occur in water systems that contain chloramines. The problem is greatest when temperatures are warm and water usage is low. . Source: NH3 . Sink: NO2/NO3 . Ammonification - Ammonification. When an organism excretes waste or dies, the nitrogen in its tissues is in the form of organic nitrogen (e.g. amino acids, DNA). Various fungi and prokaryotes then decompose the tissue and release inorganic nitrogen back into the ecosystem as ammonia in the process known as ammonification. . Assimilation - Assimilation. Assimilation is the process by which plants and animals incorporate the NO3- and ammonia formed through nitrogen fixation and nitrification. Plants take up these forms of nitrogen through their roots, and incorporate them into plant proteins and nucleic acids. . Denitrification - Denitrification. Denitrification is the process that converts nitrate to nitrogen gas, thus removing bioavailable nitrogen and returning it to the atmosphere. Dinitrogen gas (N2) is the ultimate end product of denitrification, but other intermediate gaseous forms of nitrogen exist . The Phosphorus Cycle: . The phosphorus cycle is the movement of atoms and molecules containing the element phosphorus between sources and sinks . The phosphorus cycle can be disrupted by human activity . ______ . It is a SLOW cycle, driven mainly by geologic processes. . Phosphorus has NO atmospheric and gas stage . Phosphorus is considered a LIMITING factor in ecosystems (nitrogen is also a limiting factor) . Producers need phosphorus to grow making them vitally important in ecosystems . | Fertilizer contains phosphorus . | . . STEPS: . Start from rocks | Sediments and rocks are a major reservoir for phosphorus | . Uplift and weathering leads to phosphorus dissolving in soil . That soil phosphorus can be dissolved into lakes or streams, OR terrestrial food webs . The runoff will take the soil phosphorus that went into terrestrial food webs, from terrestrial food webs to marine food webs. . If it is runoff into the ocean, it eventually becomes sedimented in the bottom of the ocean through Lithification. . Assimilation is the process from terrestrial food webs to take up phosphorus . What is the process that movies phosphorus from rocks into soil? Uplifting and Weathering . What is the process that movies phosphorus from soil into plants? Uplifting and Weathering . . Sediments . | Uplifting and sedimentary . | The dissolved phosphorus would make its way into the marine food webs through runoff. The phosphorus would also go through sedimentation in the ocean. . | The Hydrologic Cycle . Movement of water, one of four cycles, can be disrupted. . Hydrologic cycle is driven by the SUN . Oceans are the primary reservoir for water . Ice caps and ground water reserved are smaller reservoirs (fresh water) . . STEPS: . Begins with sun, driver of the entire cycle. Why? Because it drives evaporation, it drives water up into the atmosphere. . Sublimation (Solid to gaseous without passing through liquid state) . Once the water is in the atmosphere (a reservoir), it has to come down again, so the next step is precipitation (rain, fog, drip, dew, etc.) . Once its back into terrestrial ecosystems, it collects through ice, snow, and glaciers. It also connects to lakes, wetlands, etc. . Surface runoff and snowmelt runoff help retrieve water into rivers and freshwater lakes. . Anytime precipitation falls in an area that cannot absorb it, this causes a runoff, which leads to the water into another body of water. . The water that is able to penetrate into terrestrial ecosystems enters back through infiltration and seepage. . Once it infiltrates, it can go to several locations like groundwater storage. . Eventually the groundwater ends up back in the oceans, and evaporation is repeated again thus continuing the cycle. . . Precipitation . | A higher temperature would result in more evaporation of the Earth’s water. This would also result in a larger amount of precipitation. Under certain circumstances this could also produce more severe weather events such as storms, and hurricanes. . | Runoff is more likely to increase since the precipitation is more likely to land on buildings with impervious surfaces instead of grounds that could absorb water. This can reduce groundwater recharge and cause droughts to become more severe. (Interesting) . | Ecosystem Mr. Hendricks Notes: .",
